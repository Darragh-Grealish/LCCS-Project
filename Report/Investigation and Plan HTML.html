    <!--Evidence of Research-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <div id="feature2">
        <h3>Evidence of Research</h3>
    <p>I decided to create a smart home system. I researched my idea online.  
        I researched my idea online. I read <a href="https://www.smarthome.com/">Smart Home’s</a>  website and watched their <a href="https://youtu.be/JGa8FeDVm7U">YouTube </a> videos.
        <p>I found that a smart home uses devices connected via the internet to allow homeowners remote monitoring and/or control of both appliances and systems with an app or on a web page. </p>
        <p>These types of automation provide added security, convenience, comfort and energy efficiency.</p>
        <ul><li>They remotely control lighting systems turning lights on/off from another room. </li>
        <li>They schedule and monitor thermostats, by setting the thermostat on a timer thus energy efficiency is increased.</li>
        <li>They control access through smart locks and monitor security cameras increasing home security.</li>
        </ul>
        Examples of artificial-intelligence-powered smart home assistants are Amazon’s Alexa or Google Home. However, they’re costly and raise privacy issues as someone could hack the system.

    <!--Solutions---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <div id="feature2">
    <p><img align="right" height="130" src="https://brain-images-ssl.cdn.dixons.com/2/1/10226912/u_10226912.jpg">I researched the following solutions – using the internet and a micro:bit IoT kit.</p>
    <h3>Existing Solutions:</h3>
    <p>1.  Ring video doorbell hardwired - €55 
        Features: Live HD video, Motion Detection, Night Vision, 2-way audio and Motion Detection.
        This allows remote viewing of your front door from your smartphone, this benefits security for residents when not at home.
    </p>
    <p><img align="right" height="130px" src="https://media.littlewoodsireland.ie/i/littlewoodsireland/N3H7N_SQ2_0000000238_STEEL_SLd?$300x400_retinamobilex2$">2.  Google Nest Thermostat 3rd Generation - €260
        Features: provides remote temperature control using your smartphone, an energy consumption report. Heat switches on when you walk in the room and turns off when you’ve left, thus reduces energy use.
        </p>
    <h3>Possible Solutions</h3>
    <p>3.  A <u>Plant Watering System</u> controls soil moisture level.
    A pump submerged into a water supply pipes water into the pot, a sensor in the plant pot and an ‘if statement’ to determine if the moisture level read in requires water to be pumped to the plant. 
    This system provides the optimum amount of water daily, solving the problem of forgetting to water the plants and will optimise plant growth.</p>

    <p>4.  Voice Activated Lighting switches lights on whenever noise in a room reaches a predefined level. 
    A noise sensor and lights connected to a micro:bit and an ‘if statement’ to turn lights on when the required noise level is reached.
    This eliminates the need to search a dark, empty room for a light switch, as an increase in noise will turn the lights on.</p>

    <!--My System-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <div id="feature2">
        <h3>My System</h3>
        <p>My room monitoring system’s objective is to monitor the room’s temperature, dust level, door status and any flame. This information is displayed on a website for the homeowners and allows them to know the status of every room. This provides homeowners with affordable home protection, prompting them to close their doors and reducing home insurance costs.   </p>
            <p>My system will be useful and marketable to all people, accommodating a wide range of abilities regardless of user’s body size, posture or mobility. It’s easily understood, comfortable to use, tolerant to errors and necessary information is communicated effectively.</p>
            <p><b>Stakeholders</b> are device manufacturers, service providers - sell product/service, platform providers of software and end-users.</p>
            <p><b>Target end users</b> are people looking to reduce their house insurance costs whilst protecting their homes from environmental damage caused by fire and smoke. </p>
            <p><b>Social implications:</b> Increased home security, monitors dust levels which improves health, financial - reduced insurance costs.</p>
            <p><b>Deeper Research:</b> There is a viable market for my solution. Many insurance companies discount 5-20% for security systems and higher discounts for environmental monitoring, detecting fire, smoke and water damage.  </p>
            <p><b>Technologies</b> to be used are LEDs, OLED display, batteries, embedded system, flame, dust and temperature sensors, database, programming and scripting languages. Further research found that embedded systems work well in smart homes. The internet sends data to a program for cleaning and sorting, then to an cloud database such as firebase. The website fetches the data and graphs it using JavaScript and my unique firebase credentials.</p>
